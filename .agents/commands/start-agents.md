See if there are any active tmux sessions prefixed with `sheet-scanner` with idle agents running in them. If so, kill them. Then, I want you to start up new tmux sessions prefixed with `sheet-scanner` and run the command `amp --dangerously-allow-all` in each session. This will start up a fresh coding agent. You can start as many agents as necessary. Once an agent is running, I want you to send the following prompt to it: `Before you do anything else, introduce yourself to the other agents via agent mail. Then coordinate to work on the remaining beads.` Do not forget to hit `enter` after submitting the prompt. Always make sure that all tests pass and that the code is linted correctly.
